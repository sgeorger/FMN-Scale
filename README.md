# Forget-Me-Not Scale

The FMN Scale is a two part system involving a scale and a door alarm system. Simply plug in both systems and allow the scale to remain empty for 10 seconds to tare. The scale should be placed flat when it is plugged in in order to let it tare properly.

After setup, place any item you don't want to forget to take with you on the scale, and the door alarm system will alert you if you try to leave home without your item.

The FMN Scale includes an indicator LED and alarm disable button on the door alarm system. The indicator LED will light when the alarm is armed. Hence, opening the door while the LED is lit will trigger the alarm.

The disable alarm button should be held for 1 second to ensure proper triggering. When pressed, alarms will be disabled for 10 seconds. This button can be used whether an alarm is currently sounding or not. In the case an alarm is sounding, it will turn off the alarm. Then, alarms will be disabled until either 10 seconds elapse or the door is closed after 10 seconds elapse. In all cases, the indicator LED will be turned off while alarms are disabled.

The FMN Scale currently has no custom reset function. However, users can reset the systems individually by holding the reset button on the Arduino board. This may be useful if the system is not behaving as expected.
